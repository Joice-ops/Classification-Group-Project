# Customer Churn Prediction 

## Introduction

This project involves building a predictive model to determine whether customers of a fictional telecommunications company will churn. Churn analysis is crucial for understanding why customers discontinue their services and what factors contribute to this decision. The dataset contains information about 7043 customers in California, including various demographic details, a Churn Score, and a Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) index.
